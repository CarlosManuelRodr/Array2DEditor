# 2DArrayEditor

Use this if you want to deal with 2D arrays easily within the inspector of Unity.

## Getting Started

For a quick import into an existing project, just get the UnityPackage.

The 2DArrayEditor folder is an empty project with only the plugin imported and some examples! :)

Then, when you're in your project:

- Right click in your Project or Hierarchy window, or go to the Assets menu tab.
- Go to Create -> Eldoir -> Piece
- A new file named "Piece_Data" is created.
- Feel free to change the grid size! :)

## Prerequisites

There are absolutely no prerequisites to this plugin.

Everything comes into a few files (and most of them are used for demo).

## Go further

We could do many things on top of this.

For example:

- Warn the user before changing the grid size, as it cleans the grid.
- Better UI to choose whatever size we want.
- Generic template to display not only arrays of booleans, but also arrays of ints, etc...
